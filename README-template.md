## Overview

This news homepage will be an excellent opportunity to practice CSS Grid. There will be lots of tricky decisions to make and plenty of learning opportunities!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("🎉");
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [WAI-ARIA basics](https://www.frontendmentor.io/learning-paths/introduction-to-web-accessibility-mXu-9PHVsd/article/6647781a20fb35b1b61abb56/read) - This helped me create more accessible and usable websites, ensuring everyone can access and benefit from the content and functionality.
- [The W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea) - Copy and paste html code into the 'Validate by direct input' textarea to check for any warnings and errors.
-  [Grid by Example](https://gridbyexample.com/examples/) - examples include an image of how the example should look in a supporting browser, they each link to a page with more information about the technique being shown, code and a CodePen of the example. Unless otherwise noted these examples work in any browser supporting the up to date Grid Specification. They will not work in IE10 or 11.
