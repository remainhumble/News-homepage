### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I deepened my understanding of responsive web design, particularly using CSS Grid and Flexbox together for complex layouts. I learned how to structure semantic HTML for accessibility and how to use CSS custom properties for easier theme management. Additionally, I improved my workflow by adopting a mobile-first approach.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue focusing on:

- Deepening my understanding of advanced CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts for more complex responsive designs.
- Improving accessibility by learning more about ARIA roles and best practices for inclusive web development.
- Refining my use of CSS custom properties for scalable and maintainable theming.
- Exploring component-based design systems to streamline development and ensure consistency across projects.
- Experimenting with modern CSS features like container queries and logical properties as browser support improves.

### Useful resources

- [WAI-ARIA basics](https://www.frontendmentor.io/learning-paths/introduction-to-web-accessibility-mXu-9PHVsd/article/6647781a20fb35b1b61abb56/read) - This helped me create more accessible and usable websites, ensuring everyone can access and benefit from the content and functionality.
- [The W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea) - Copy and paste html code into the 'Validate by direct input' textarea to check for any warnings and errors.
- [Grid by Example](https://gridbyexample.com/examples/) - examples include an image of how the example should look in a supporting browser, they each link to a page with more information about the technique being shown, code and a CodePen of the example. Unless otherwise noted these examples work in any browser supporting the up to date Grid Specification. They will not work in IE10 or 11.
